Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data acquisition is a key aspect of every experiment, since without it nothing
 can be learned.
 During the history of science, instrumentation and knowledge formed a feedback
 loop, where better instruments have provided humans with better understanding
 of natural fenomena which allows the develpment of more advanced instruments.
 This relation is cleary visible on the development of electronics during
 the past decades.
 Long running physics experiments are naturally sensitive to these developments
 and the design of their data acquisition systems must take this into account.
 As these systems become ever more complex, the concept of CODAC emerges.
 CODAC stands for Control, Data Access and Communication and can be considered
 an extension of the CODAS (control and data acquisition system) as it treats
 all systems that are part of an experiment (namely control of the experiment,
 data collection, data access and plant security) as a whole.
 Although te specific needs of an experiment must be taken into account
 when designing a CODAC, there are several key features that should be taken
 into acount.
 This thesis uses the implementation of a CODAC for a specific experiment
 as the starting point for a study on how to design a CODAC for modern,
 large physicals experiments, taking into account not just their specific
 needs but also a boarder view.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the installation of the COMPASS tokamak in Prague, it was necessary
 to install a CODAC system for the experiment.
 Over the years, new diagnostics and actuators would be installed and thus
 required to be integrated on the CODAC.
 During this time, the CODAC itself, its design and software would need
 to be updated to answer new challenges and issues.
