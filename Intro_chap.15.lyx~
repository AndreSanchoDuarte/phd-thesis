Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data acquisition is a key aspect of every experiment, since without it nothing
 can be learned.
 During the history of science, instrumentation and knowledge formed a feedback
 loop, where better instruments have provided humans with better understanding
 of natural fenomena which allows the develpment of more advanced instruments.
 This relation is cleary visible on the development of electronics during
 the past decades.
 Long running physics experiments are naturally sensitive to these developments
 and the design of their data acquisition systems must take this into account.
 As these systems become ever more complex, the concept of CODAC emerges.
 CODAC stands for Control, Data Access and Communication and can be considered
 an extension of the CODAS (control and data acquisition system) as it treats
 all systems that are part of an experiment (namely control of the experiment,
 data collection, data access and plant security) as a whole.
 Although te specific needs of an experiment must be taken into account
 when designing a CODAC, there are several key features that should be taken
 into acount.
 This thesis uses the implementation of a CODAC for a specific experiment
 as the starting point for a study on how to design a CODAC for modern,
 large physicals experiments, taking into account not just their specific
 needs but also a boarder view.

\begin_layout Section
Nuclear fusion technology and research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fusion is a nuclear reaction where light elements are merged (fused) into
 a another, heavier, element.
 Although any element can be fused this way, it typicaly involves hydrogen
 and its isotopes, deuterium and tritium, being this the main reaction that
 powers our Sun.
 Since this reaction produces a great amount of energy, the main goal for
 fusion research is to apply it to produce electricity, as an efficient
 and clean alternative to existing power sources, namely fossil fules.
 Of all the fusion reactions available the deuterium-tritium technology
 is the most promissing: not only is the most energetic, it is also the
 one that occurs at faster rate.
 Besides, deuterium is abundant on ocean water, from where it can be easily
 extracted and tritium, although not occuring naturaly on Earth, can be
 obtained from Lithium which is a very common metal.
 However this reaction also generates fast neutrons that activate the structures
 of a fusion reactor, this being its biggest environmental issue.
 These same neutrons, on the other hand, can be used to breed tritium from
 lithium, meaning that there should be no need to handle tritium (which
 is radioactive itself) outside of the fusion chamber.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for fusion reactions to occur certain densities and temperatures
 are required and for these to be fullfilled the elements must be on a confined
 plasma state.
 There are three ways to confine a plasma: gravitational, magnetic and inertial.
 Gravitational confinement is the one responsible for energy production
 in stars, so it is not viable on Earth.
 Inertial confinement uses powerful lasers to compress fusion fuel pellets
 during short periods of time.
 Magnetic confinement uses the fact that ions and electrons follow magnetic
 lines to keep the plasma inside a partial-vacuum chamber.
 The most common magnetic configurations are the Tokamak and the Stellarator.
 Both have toroidal shapes, their main difference being how a poloidal magnetic
 field, necessary to stabilize the plasma, is generated: in a tokamak a
 plasma current is induced by varying the magnetic flux on the central core
 (like in a transformer); in a stellarator by specially shaped external
 coils.
 Until now, the tokamak is the most successful magnetic geometry and is
 widely considered the best candidate for a commercial fusion power plant.

\begin_layout Section
COMPASS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tokamak COMPASS (COMPact ASSembly) is installed in the Institute of Plasma
 Physics (IPP) of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic since 2006.
 It was designed in the 1980s in the British Culham Science Centre to study
 plasma physics in circular and D shaped plasmas, with the purpose to prepare
 for ITER scenarios.
 In fact, the relations between its dimensions are very similar to those
 of ITER.
 At the turn of the 21st century, the Culham Science Centre started working
 with a new spherical tokamak, the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST),
 and so operation of COMPASS was discontinued.
 However, due to its relevance for the ITER project, it was offered to IPP
 - Prague which had experience with small tokamaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, the main objectives of COMPASS are related to ITER, specially:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
study of H-mode physics (there are only two other operational tokamaks in
 Europe capable of this regime);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MHD equilibrium and instabilities;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Plasma-wall interaction;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Physics of runaways and disruption;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Developments of advance diagnostic methods;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ISTTOK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tokamak ISTTOK (Instituto Superior Técnico TOKamak) is installed in Lisbon
 at the institute that gives it the name and is explored by IPFN.
 It is a small tokamak with a circular cross-section, a poloidal graphite
 limiter and an iron core transformer, that was built from the former TORTUR
 tokamak, which was de-commissioned by the Association EURATOM/FOM in 1988.
 The ISTTOK construction started, officially, on January 1st, 1990, date
 on which the contract of association EURATOM/IST enter into force.
 The operation of this experiment in an inductive regime started on February
 1991.
 Its main objectives are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Teach and train personnel (mainly university students) in physics, engineering
 and technologies associated with nuclear fusion;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Development of new diagnostic techniques and to develop and test digital
 instrumentation dedicated to control and data acquisition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 2012, thanks to fast electronics developed at IPFN and real-time control,
 ISTTOK has been operating on AC discharges, where the direction of the
 plasma current changes quickly enough to allow the pulse to be continued,
 keeping a somewhat constant plasma density without saturating the iron
 core.
 This has allowed discharge duration to go from 25-40 ms up to more than
 0.5 s (although the typical discharge is around 200 ms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the installation of the COMPASS tokamak in Prague, it was necessary
 to install a CODAC system for the experiment.
 Over the years, new diagnostics and actuators were expected be installed
 and thus required to be integrated on the CODAC.
 The operation would be based on the novel ATCA control and acquisition
 boards developed on IPFN (Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear).
 These possess advanced technical features, namely state-of-art FPGA for
 signal processing, multi-Gigabit/s point-to point serial links for super-fast
 data sharing across all the input channels and a sub nano-second synchronous
 timing/event distribution network.
 This system was similar to the one used on the ISTTOK tokamak in Lisbon.
 The knowledge obtained during the design, installation and maintenace can
 be extrapolated to other experiments, future and current, thus becoming
 the basis for the work presented on this thesis.
