\begin_layout Section
Fast Acquisition Node
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This C++ node was developed for PCIe (need reference) acquisition boards.
 These boards have 32 18-bit ADC channels that can acquire up to 2 Mega
 samples per second.
 The node accesses directly the board through driver commands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the node interface it is possible to configure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Clock source: choice between shared (common to all boards on the same crate)
 or local
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trigger source: choice between shared or local
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trigger type: choice between software (acquisition begins immediately) or
 hardware (waits for external trigger)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acquisition time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trigger delay: configurable delay, in ms, from the trigger arrival and the
 acquisition start
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Delay time: delay to be added to the data timestamps, to compensate for
 possible trigger differences with other boards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides these fields, there are three other that are not configurable, being
 used for information and reference:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frequency: the acquisition rate is fixed at 2 Msamples/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On board memory size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DMA byte size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This node defines a main event that usually refers to the plasma start.
 When a new event arrives the configurations are sent to the boards, which
 then wait for trigger.
 In case software trigger is selected, a call is made to the driver, starting
 the acquisition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acquired data is tranfered to the node as a signed 32 bit integer array,
 with the extra bits padded with 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
16-bit Node
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the data transmission and storage point of view, using 32 bits to store
 18 bit values results in 43.75% of space being wasted.
 To improve this situation, two solutions were considered: compress the
 data or only store the 16 most significant bits.
 Some tests were performed to evaluate these solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using some acquisitions when there was no plasma on the chamber, we analysed
 the noise level coming from the boards.
 Assuming it was gaussian noise, we took the standard deviation.
 We can see some examples on the next table
