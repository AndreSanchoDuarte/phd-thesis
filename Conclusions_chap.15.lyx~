Achievements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During my doctorate most of my work was done for COMPASS, with it being
 adapted and reused for other projects namely ISTTOK.
 It started with the installation of the first CODAC software, similar to
 the existing setup on ISTTOK.
 I designed and developed the FireSignal Node in Java connecting to MARTe,
 which included a parser for the configuration language of MARTe.
 This Node is working also in ISTTOK.
 The parser by itself was later used also for the Fast Plant System for
 ITER project, which used Java to connect a MARTe system with EPICS.
 I also participated on the integration of the Reflectometry diagnostic
 in COMPASS.
 For this I adapted and debugged an existing C++ Node for the acquisition
 boards, and also developed another node for configuring the wave launcher,
 using telnet protocol (the default method of configuraing that specific
 wave launcher).

For the transition to CDB in COMPASS, I participated on the design phase
 of the system and the way it was going to interact with FireSignal.
 During the development stage, I developed the first version of the FireSignal
 database controller for CDB and during the deployment I helped with the
 Python code that converted existing data from the old format to the new
 one.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The collaboration between IPFN and IPP continues, but currently COMPASS
 has an autonomous CODAC team that has developed their own forks of IPFN
 technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changes to FireSignal in ISTTOK are being considered, namely: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Replacing the raw binary files with HDF5 files; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for data compression; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for signal previews (decimation); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using web technologies to create a more robust yet flexible user interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these are successful, it may be possible to also apply them to COMPASS

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Java-based technology has its drawbacks: High memory usage (plotting
 data) Java Web Start security has tightened (extra configuration required
 to launch applications) The FireSignal/SDAS database lacks flexibility:
 In some cases it makes more sense to store a time array Changes to nodes
 may affect the retrieval of previously stored data The event paradigm is
 sound, but having the pulse treated as a special event still makes sense
 CDB addresses these issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single application providing all functionalities sounds good in theory,
 but in practice has its issues: Becomes more prone to crashes and freezes
 Too much information can overload the user Changing a component will inevitably
 affect everything CORBA has proved to be a good solution for the interoperabili
ty of different FireSignal modules However, the larger overhead means that
 it is not the best solution for data transfer Thanks to the modular design
 of FireSignal, the complexity of integrating different subsystems was reduced.
